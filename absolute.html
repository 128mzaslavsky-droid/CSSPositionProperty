    <h1>Understanding absolute paths in HTML</h1>
    <p>
        An absolute path in HTML specifies the full URL or file path to a resource, starting from the root directory. This means that the path is complete and does not depend on the location of the HTML file that references it.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of an absolute path:</h2>
    <p>
        If you have an image located at <code>https://www.example.com/images/photo.jpg</code>, you would use the following HTML code to include it in your webpage:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;img src="https://www.example.com/images/photo.jpg" alt="Example Photo"&gt;</pre>
    <h2>Key points to remember about absolute paths:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute paths start from the root directory and include the full URL or file path.</li>
        <li>They are useful when linking to resources that are hosted on different domains or servers.</li>
        <li>Using absolute paths ensures that the resource can be accessed regardless of the location of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>However, they can make your code less portable if you move your files to a different domain or server.</li>
    </ul>
