    <h1>Understanding relative paths in HTML</h1>
    <p>
        A relative path in HTML specifies the location of a resource relative to the current document. This means that the path is based on the directory structure of your website or project.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of a relative path:</h2>
    <p>
        If you have an image located in a folder called <code>images</code> within the same directory as your HTML file, you would use the following HTML code to include it:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="Example Photo"&gt;</pre>
    <h2>Key points to remember about relative paths:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Relative paths are based on the location of the current HTML file.</li>
        <li>They are useful for linking to resources within the same website or project.</li>
        <li>Using relative paths makes your code more portable and easier to move between different environments.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of the directory structure to ensure the paths are correct.</li>
    </ul>
